Upon the creation of the universe, all the evil inside of it was concentrated into one being. The Original Majin. As the Kai's were creating their universe, this being attacked them, planning on killing them and absorbing them. However, with the help of the Supreme Kai, the Majin was sealed in a pod. The only thing that could revive it was power that only the Kai's possessed at the time. However, mortals would eventually come to this realm of power as well. A demon who was shamed and nearly killed for their treachery to the Demon Lord escaped at the last second, fleeing through a portal which he then sealed up. He concealed his identity and ran off to the edges of the universe, hoping to one day revive The Original Majin and become the ruler of heaven, hell, and all of the realms. But this time would not come soon...
<br>
<br>
The Angel of the universe had chosen a god of destruction, a being who helped make the universe a really good place. Life flourished, and the races that are in the universe as we know it today are because the G.o.D made the universe a safer place for them to develop. However, after millions of years, the G.o.D grew bored, lazy, and elderly. The universe no longer had its safeguard, and evil was slowly rising again in the form of Demons, Frost Lords, and Saiyans. By the time the mythical Super Saiyan ascended to its third state, the G.o.D will have passed away, and the Angel would search for a new one.
<br>
<br>
The Grand Elder Namekian of Planet Namek sent a few Warrior and Dragon clan Namekians off on a large ship that an intelligent businessman Namekian created. For twenty years, the Namekians traveled in space, gathering lots of knowledge. However, a run in with a Frost Lord desperately damaged their ship, and they fled back to Namek before the ship was completely destroyed. The Grand Elder listened to their tales, and wrote the Namekian Book of Legends, entailing stories of Namekian, Human, Saiyan, Alien, and more. Disappointed that the Namekians wrecked the ship that the Businessman Namekian made, he decided to use the last of his resources to make one more, this time fleeing Namek on his own to start his own business in the galaxy.
